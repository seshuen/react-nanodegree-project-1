# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The project consist of two major component with few sub components.

1. Main page: This page shows list of books as per their shelf value (`Currently Ready`, `Want to Read`, `Read`).
2. Search: Here you can search the books by their title or author name.

The project was built over [Udacity's starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## Instruction

For starting the project:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, Udacity had provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll();
```

- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf);
```

- book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
- shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults);
```

- query: `<String>`
- maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
